Thanks for trying our new 7th gen terminal.

We're still at 1.0.X so things might break. It's quite safe - all
your work is on the server and eventually you'll manage to reconnect.

Worst case scenarios is you'll have to close & open the app
and press CTRL-L in each pane.

CTRL-L has been refreshing terminals since the 70s, use it freely. 

If the connection gets stuck there you can reset the connection by 
switching to another app and back.

If switching doesn't help, the problem is probably state related. Close the
app and re-open.

If all fails or you found a recurring issue, 
please take a screenshot, copt the log - ⌘` - and email us at
support@terminal7.dev
